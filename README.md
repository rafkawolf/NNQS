This repository includes the code for my bachelor thesis "Solving the 1D Transverse Field Ising Modek with Neural Network Quantum States".
It uses the libraries NetKet and DMRGPy which are referenced in said thesis.
The graphs generated in the notebook are from a most recent simulation which is why they may vary from the figures presented in the thesis.
For example they may include some unexpected fluctuations etc.
